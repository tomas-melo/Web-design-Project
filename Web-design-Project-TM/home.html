        <h3> Bem-vindo! , Welcome !</h3>
        <p>Porto (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpoɾtu]), also known in English as Oporto, is the second largest city in Portugal after Lisbon, 
          the capital of the Porto District, and one of the Iberian Peninsula's major urban areas. Porto city proper, which is the entire 
          municipality of Porto, is small compared to its metropolitan area, with an estimated population of just 231,800 people in a 
          municipality with only 41.42 km2 (16 sq mi). Porto's metropolitan area has around 1.7 million people (2021) in an area of 2,395 km2 
          (925 sq mi), making it the second-largest urban area in Portugal. It is recognized as a global city with a Gamma + rating from the 
          Globalization and World Cities Research Network.
        </p>
        <p>Located along the Douro River estuary in northern Portugal, Porto is one of the oldest European centers, and its core was proclaimed 
          a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996, as the "Historic Centre of Porto, Luiz I Bridge and Monastery of Serra do Pilar". The 
          historic area is also a National Monument of Portugal. The western part of its urban area extends to the coastline of the Atlantic 
          Ocean. Its settlement dates back many centuries when it was an outpost of the Roman Empire. Its combined Celtic-Latin name, 
          Portus Cale, has been referred to as the origin of the name Portugal, based on transliteration and oral evolution from Latin.
        </p>
        <p>Port wine, one of Portugal's most famous exports, is named after Porto, since the metropolitan area, and in particular the cellars
          of Vila Nova de Gaia, were responsible for the packaging, transport, and export of fortified wine. In 2014 and 2017, Porto was 
          elected The Best European Destination by the Best European Destinations Agency. Porto is on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino 
          de Santiago.
        </p>
        <p>In 1996, UNESCO recognized Porto's historic center as a World Heritage Site. Among the architectural highlights of the city, 
          Oporto Cathedral is the oldest surviving structure, together with the small romanesque Church of Cedofeita, the gothic Igreja de 
          São Francisco (Church of Saint Francis), the remnants of the city walls and a few 15th-century houses. The baroque style is well 
          represented in the city in the elaborate gilt work interior decoration of the churches of St. Francis (São Francisco) and St. Claire 
          (Santa Clara), the churches of Mercy (Misericórdia) and of the Clerics (Clérigos), the Episcopal Palace of Porto, and others. 
          The neoclassicism and romanticism of the 19th and 20th centuries also added interesting monuments to the landscape of the city, 
          like the magnificent Stock Exchange Palace (Palácio da Bolsa), the Hospital of Saint Anthony, the Municipality, the buildings in 
          the Liberdade Square and the Avenida dos Aliados, the tile-adorned São Bento railway station and the gardens of the Crystal Palace 
          (Palácio de Cristal). A guided visit to the Palácio da Bolsa, and in particular, the Arab Room is a major tourist attraction.
        </p>
        <p>Many of the city's oldest houses are at risk of collapsing. The population in Oporto municipality dropped by nearly 100,000 
          since the 1980s, but the number of permanent residents in the outskirts and satellite towns has grown strongly.
