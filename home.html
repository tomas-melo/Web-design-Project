          <h2>Highlights of Porto : </h2>
          <ol role="list">
            <li>Porto's historic centre is one of the oldest in Europe and has been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The narrow cobbled streets, colourful houses and centuries-old churches offer a glimpse into the city's rich history.</li>
            <li>The bridges spanning the Douro River, such as the Dom Luís I Bridge, are emblematic of Porto. These majestic structures offer panoramic views over the city and are masterpieces of engineering. They also create a unique and memorable urban landscape.</li>
            <li>Porto is a hotbed of culture and art. Museums, art galleries and theatres abound, showcasing the city's cultural heritage. Festivals and artistic events throughout the year make Porto a dynamic place for art and culture lovers.</li>
            <li>Although Porto is often associated with its historic architecture, the city also offers access to magnificent beaches. The fine sandy beaches of Foz do Douro offer a tranquil escape, and the proximity of the sea provides opportunities for water sports and relaxing in the sun.</li>

          <h2>Celebrities Testimonials</h2>
        <p>Port wine, one of Portugal's most famous exports, is named after Porto, since the metropolitan area, and in particular the cellars
          of Vila Nova de Gaia, were responsible for the packaging, transport, and export of fortified wine. In 2014 and 2017, Porto was 
          elected The Best European Destination by the Best European Destinations Agency. Porto is on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino 
          de Santiago.
        </p>
        <p>In 1996, UNESCO recognized Porto's historic center as a World Heritage Site. Among the architectural highlights of the city, 
          Oporto Cathedral is the oldest surviving structure, together with the small romanesque Church of Cedofeita, the gothic Igreja de 
          São Francisco (Church of Saint Francis), the remnants of the city walls and a few 15th-century houses. The baroque style is well 
          represented in the city in the elaborate gilt work interior decoration of the churches of St. Francis (São Francisco) and St. Claire 
          (Santa Clara), the churches of Mercy (Misericórdia) and of the Clerics (Clérigos), the Episcopal Palace of Porto, and others. 
          The neoclassicism and romanticism of the 19th and 20th centuries also added interesting monuments to the landscape of the city, 
          like the magnificent Stock Exchange Palace (Palácio da Bolsa), the Hospital of Saint Anthony, the Municipality, the buildings in 
          the Liberdade Square and the Avenida dos Aliados, the tile-adorned São Bento railway station and the gardens of the Crystal Palace 
          (Palácio de Cristal). A guided visit to the Palácio da Bolsa, and in particular, the Arab Room is a major tourist attraction.
        </p>
        <p>Many of the city's oldest houses are at risk of collapsing. The population in Oporto municipality dropped by nearly 100,000 
          since the 1980s, but the number of permanent residents in the outskirts and satellite towns has grown strongly.
